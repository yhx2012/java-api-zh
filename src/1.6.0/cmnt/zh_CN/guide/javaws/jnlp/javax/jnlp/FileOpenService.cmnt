public interface javax.jnlp.FileOpenService
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 <code>FileOpenService</code> service allows the user to choose a file
 from the local file system, even for applications that
 are running in the untrusted execution environment. The JNLP Client is the mediator
 and is therefore responsible for providing the specific implementation
 of this, if any.
 <p>
 This service provides a similar function as the file input field for HTML-based
 forms.

  along with the name of the file. The full path is not returned.

  @param  pathHint  A hint from the application to the initial directory for
                    the file chooser. This might be ignored by the JNLP
                    Client.

  @param extensions A list of default extensions to show in the file chooser.
                    For example, <code>String[] { "txt", "java" }</code>.
                    This might be ignored by the JNLP Client.

  @return A <code>FileContent</code> object with information about the
          chosen file, or <code>null</code> if the user did not choose a file.

  @exception <code>IOException</code> if the request failed in any way other than the user did not
                    choose to select a file.
