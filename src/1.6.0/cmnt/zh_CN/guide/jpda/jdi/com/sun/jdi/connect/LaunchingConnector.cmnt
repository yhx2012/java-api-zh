<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Launches an application and connects to its VM. Properties
 of the launch (possibly including options,
 main class, and arguments) are specified in
 <code>arguments</code>. 
 The argument map associates argument name strings to instances
 of {@link Connector.Argument}. The default argument map for a 
 connector can be obtained through {@link Connector#defaultArguments}.
 Argument map values can be changed, but map entries should not be
 added or deleted.
 <p>A target VM launched by a launching connector is not
 guaranteed to be stable until after the {@link com.sun.jdi.event.VMStartEvent} has been
 received.
 <p>
 <b>Important note:</b> If a target VM is launched through this 
 funcctions, its output and error streams must be read as it 
 executes. These streams are available through the 
 {@link java.lang.Process Process} object returned by 
 {@link com.sun.jdi.VirtualMachine#process}. If the streams are not periodically
 read, the target VM will stop executing when the buffers for these
 streams are filled. 

 @param arguments the argument map to be used in launching the VM. 
 @return the {@link VirtualMachine} mirror of the target VM.
 @throws java.io.IOException when unable to launch. 
 Specific exceptions are dependent on the Connector implementation
 in use. 
 @throws IllegalConnectorArgumentsException when one of the  
 connector arguments is invalid.
 @throws VMStartException when the VM was successfully launched, but 
 terminated with an error before a connection could be established.
