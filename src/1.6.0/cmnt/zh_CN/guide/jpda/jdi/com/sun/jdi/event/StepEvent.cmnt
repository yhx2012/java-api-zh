<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Notification of step completion in the target VM. 
 The step event 
 is generated immediately before the code at its location is executed;
 thus, if the step is entering a new method (as might occur with
 {@link com.sun.jdi.request.StepRequest#STEP_INTO StepRequest.STEP_INTO})
 the location of the event is the first instruction of the method.
 When a step leaves a method, the location of the event will be the
 first instruction after the call in the calling method; note that
 this location may not be at a line boundary, even if 
 {@link com.sun.jdi.request.StepRequest#STEP_LINE StepRequest.STEP_LINE}
 was used.
