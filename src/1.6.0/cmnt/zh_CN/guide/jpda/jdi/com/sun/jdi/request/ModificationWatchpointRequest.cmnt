public interface com.sun.jdi.request.ModificationWatchpointRequest extends com.sun.jdi.request.WatchpointRequest
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Request for notification when a field is set.
 This event will be triggered when a value is assigned to the specified
 field with a Java<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> programming
 language statement (assignment, increment, etc) or by a
 Java Native Interface (JNI) set function (<code>Set&lt;Type&gt;Field,
 SetStatic&lt;Type&gt;Field</code>).
 Setting a field to a value which is the same as the previous value
 still triggers this event.
 Modification by JDI does not trigger this event.
 When an enabled 
 ModificationWatchpointRequest is satisfied, an
 {@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventSet event set} containing a
 {@link com.sun.jdi.event.ModificationWatchpointEvent ModificationWatchpointEvent}
 will be placed on 
 the {@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventQueue EventQueue}.
 The collection of existing
 watchpoints is 
 managed by the {@link EventRequestManager}.
