<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 <p/>
 Register an instance of an implementation of this class with a {@link Marshaller} to externally listen
 for marshal events.
 <p/>
 <p/>
 This class enables pre and post processing of each marshalled object.
 The event callbacks are called when marshalling from an instance that maps to an xml element or
 complex type definition. The event callbacks are not called when marshalling from an instance of a
 Java datatype that represents a simple type definition.
 <p/>
 <p/>
 External listener is one of two different mechanisms for defining marshal event callbacks.
 See <a href="Marshaller.html#marshalEventCallback">Marshal Event Callbacks</a> for an overview.

<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 <p/>
 Callback method invoked before marshalling from <tt>source</tt> to XML.
 <p/>
 <p/>
 This method is invoked just before marshalling process starts to marshal <tt>source</tt>.
 Note that if the class of <tt>source</tt> defines its own <tt>beforeMarshal</tt> method,
 the class specific callback method is invoked just before this method is invoked.

 @param source instance of JAXB mapped class prior to marshalling from it.

public void javax.xml.bind.Marshaller.Listener.afterMarshal(Object source)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 <p/>
 Callback method invoked after marshalling <tt>source</tt> to XML.
 <p/>
 <p/>
 This method is invoked after <tt>source</tt> and all its descendants have been marshalled.
 Note that if the class of <tt>source</tt> defines its own <tt>afterMarshal</tt> method,
 the class specific callback method is invoked just before this method is invoked.

 @param source instance of JAXB mapped class after marshalling it.
