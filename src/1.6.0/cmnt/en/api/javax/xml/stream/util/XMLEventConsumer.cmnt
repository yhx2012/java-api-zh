 This interface defines an event consumer interface.  The contract of the 
 of a consumer is to accept the event.  This interface can be used to 
 mark an object as able to receive events.  Add may be called several 
 times in immediate succession so a consumer must be able to cache
 events it hasn't processed yet.

<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 This method adds an event to the consumer. Calling this method 
 invalidates the event parameter. The client application should 
 discard all references to this event upon calling add. 
 The behavior of an application that continues to use such references 
 is undefined.

 @param event the event to add, may not be null
