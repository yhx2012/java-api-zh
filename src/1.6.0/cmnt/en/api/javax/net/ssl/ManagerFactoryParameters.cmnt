public interface javax.net.ssl.ManagerFactoryParameters
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->

 This class is the base interface for providing
 algorithm-specific information to a KeyManagerFactory or
 TrustManagerFactory.
 <P>
 In some cases, initialization parameters other than keystores
 may be needed by a provider.  Users of that particular provider
 are expected to pass an implementation of the appropriate
 sub-interface of this class as defined by the
 provider.  The provider can then call the specified methods in
 the <CODE>ManagerFactoryParameters</CODE> implementation to obtain the
 needed information.
