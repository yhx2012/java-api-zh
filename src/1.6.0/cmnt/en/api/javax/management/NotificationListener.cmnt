public void javax.management.NotificationListener.handleNotification(Notification notification, Object handback)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Invoked when a JMX notification occurs.
 The implementation of this method should return as soon as possible, to avoid
 blocking its notification broadcaster.

 @param notification The notification.    
 @param handback An opaque object which helps the listener to associate information
 regarding the MBean emitter. This object is passed to the MBean during the
 addListener call and resent, without modification, to the listener. The MBean object 
 should not use or modify the object.
