public class javax.swing.event.TreeSelectionEvent extends java.util.EventObject
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 An event that characterizes a change in the current
 selection.  The change is based on any number of paths.
 TreeSelectionListeners will generally query the source of
 the event for the new selected status of each potentially
 changed row.
 <p>
 <strong>Warning:</strong>
 Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>
 has been added to the <code>java.beans</code> package.
 Please see {@link java.beans.XMLEncoder}.

 Returns true if the path identified by path was added to the
 selection. A return value of false means the path was in the
 selection but is no longer in the selection. This will raise if
 path is not one of the paths identified by this event.

 Returns true if the path identified by <code>index</code> was added to
 the selection. A return value of false means the path was in the
 selection but is no longer in the selection. This will raise if
 index < 0 || >= <code>getPaths</code>.length.
