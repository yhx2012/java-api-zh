<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public interface javax.swing.text.Position
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Represents a location within a document.  It is intended to abstract away
 implementation details of the document and enable specification of
 positions within the document that are capable of tracking of change as
 the document is edited.
 <p>
 A {@code Position} object points at a location between two characters.
 As the surrounding content is altered, the {@code Position} object
 adjusts its offset automatically to reflect the changes. If content is
 inserted or removed before the {@code Position} object's location, then the
 {@code Position} increments or decrements its offset, respectively,
 so as to point to the same location. If a portion of the document is removed
 that contains a {@code Position}'s offset, then the {@code Position}'s
 offset becomes that of the beginning of the removed region. For example, if
 a {@code Position} has an offset of 5 and the region 2-10 is removed, then
 the {@code Position}'s offset becomes 2.
 <p>
 {@code Position} with an offset of 0 is a special case. It never changes its
 offset while document content is altered.
