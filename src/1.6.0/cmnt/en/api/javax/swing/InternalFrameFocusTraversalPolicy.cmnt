public abstract class javax.swing.InternalFrameFocusTraversalPolicy extends java.awt.FocusTraversalPolicy
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 A FocusTraversalPolicy which can optionally provide an algorithm for
 determining a JInternalFrame's initial Component. The initial Component is
 the first to receive focus when the JInternalFrame is first selected. By
 default, this is the same as the JInternalFrame's default Component to
 focus.

public java.awt.Component javax.swing.InternalFrameFocusTraversalPolicy.getInitialComponent(JInternalFrame frame)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns the Component that should receive the focus when a
 JInternalFrame is selected for the first time. Once the JInternalFrame
 has been selected by a call to <code>setSelected(true)</code>, the
 initial Component will not be used again. Instead, if the JInternalFrame
 loses and subsequently regains selection, or is made invisible or
 undisplayable and subsequently made visible and displayable, the
 JInternalFrame's most recently focused Component will become the focus
 owner. The default implementation of this method returns the
 JInternalFrame's default Component to focus.

 @param frame the JInternalFrame whose initial Component is to be
        returned
 @return the Component that should receive the focus when frame is
         selected for the first time, or null if no suitable Component
         can be found
 @see JInternalFrame#getMostRecentFocusOwner
 @throws IllegalArgumentException if window is null
