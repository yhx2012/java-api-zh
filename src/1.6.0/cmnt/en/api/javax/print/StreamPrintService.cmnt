public abstract class javax.print.StreamPrintService extends java.lang.Object implements javax.print.PrintService
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 This class extends {@link PrintService} and represents a 
 print service that prints data in different formats to a 
 client-provided output stream.
 This is principally intended for services where
 the output format is a document type suitable for viewing 
 or archiving.
 The output format must be declared as a mime type.
 This is equivalent to an output document flavor where the
 representation class is always "java.io.OutputStream"
 An instance of the <code>StreamPrintService</code> class is
 obtained from a {@link StreamPrintServiceFactory} instance.
 <p>
 Note that a <code>StreamPrintService</code> is different from a
 <code>PrintService</code>, which supports a 
 {@link javax.print.attribute.standard.Destination Destination} 
 attribute.  A <code>StreamPrintService</code> always requires an output
 stream, whereas a <code>PrintService</code> optionally accepts a
 <code>Destination</code>. A <code>StreamPrintService</code>
 has no default destination for its formatted output.
 Additionally a <code>StreamPrintService</code> is expected to generate
output in
 a format useful in other contexts.
 StreamPrintService's are not expected to support the Destination attribute.

<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
protected javax.print.StreamPrintService(OutputStream out)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Constructs a StreamPrintService object.

 @param out  stream to which to send formatted print data.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public java.io.OutputStream javax.print.StreamPrintService.getOutputStream()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Gets the output stream.

 @return the stream to which this service will send formatted print data.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public abstract java.lang.String javax.print.StreamPrintService.getOutputFormat()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns the document format emitted by this print service.
 Must be in mimetype format, compatible with the mime type
 components of DocFlavors @see DocFlavor.
 @return mime type identifying the output format.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void javax.print.StreamPrintService.dispose()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Disposes this <code>StreamPrintService</code>.
 If a stream service cannot be re-used, it must be disposed
 to indicate this. Typically the client will call this method.
 Services which write data which cannot meaningfully be appended to
 may also dispose the stream. This does not close the stream. It
 just marks it as not for further use by this service.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public boolean javax.print.StreamPrintService.isDisposed()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns a <code>boolean</code> indicating whether or not
 this <code>StreamPrintService</code> has been disposed.
 If this object has been disposed, will return true.
 Used by services and client applications to recognize streams
 to which no further data should be written.
 @return if this <code>StreamPrintService</code> has been disposed
