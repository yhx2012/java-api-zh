<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Class PrinterResolution is a printing attribute class that specifies an 
 exact resolution supported by a printer or to be used for a print job. 
 This attribute assumes that printers have a small set of device resolutions
 at which they can operate rather than a continuum.
 <p>
 PrinterResolution is used in multiple ways: 
 <OL TYPE=1>
 <LI>
 When a client searches looking for a printer that supports the client's
 desired resolution exactly (no more, no less), the client specifies 
 an instance of class PrinterResolution indicating the exact resolution the 
 client wants. Only printers supporting that exact resolution will match the 
 search. 
 <P>
 <LI>
 When a client needs to print a job using the client's desired resolution 
 exactly (no more, no less), the client specifies an instance of class 
 PrinterResolution as an attribute of the Print Job. This will fail if the 
 Print Job doesn't support that exact resolution, and Fidelity is set to
 true.
 </OL>
 If a client wants to locate a printer supporting a resolution
 greater than some required minimum, then it may be necessary to exclude
 this attribute from a lookup request and to directly query the set of
 supported resolutions, and specify the one that most closely meets
 the client's requirements.
 In some cases this may be more simply achieved by specifying a
 PrintQuality attribute which often controls resolution.

 <B>IPP Compatibility:</B> The information needed to construct an IPP 
 <CODE>"printer-resolution"</CODE> attribute can be obtained by calling 
 methods on the PrinterResolution object. The category name returned by 
 <CODE>getName()</CODE> gives the IPP attribute name.

public javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterResolution(int crossFeedResolution, int feedResolution, int units)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Construct a new printer resolution attribute from the given items. 

 @param  crossFeedResolution
     Cross feed direction resolution.
 @param  feedResolution
     Feed direction resolution.
 @param  units
    Unit conversion factor, e.g. <code>ResolutionSyntax.DPI</CODE>
 or <code>ResolutionSyntax.>DPCM</CODE>. 

 @exception  IllegalArgumentException
     (unchecked exception) Thrown if <CODE>crossFeedResolution</CODE> < 
     1 or <CODE>feedResolution</CODE> < 1 or <CODE>units</CODE> < 1.

public boolean javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterResolution.equals(Object object)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns whether this printer resolution attribute is equivalent to the 
 passed in object. To be equivalent, all of the following conditions 
 must be true: 
 <OL TYPE=1>
 <LI>
 <CODE>object</CODE> is not null.
 <LI>
 <CODE>object</CODE> is an instance of class PrinterResolution.
 <LI>
 This attribute's cross feed direction resolution is equal to 
 <CODE>object</CODE>'s cross feed direction resolution. 
 <LI>
 This attribute's feed direction resolution is equal to
 <CODE>object</CODE>'s feed direction resolution. 
 </OL>

 @param  object  Object to compare to.

 @return  True if <CODE>object</CODE> is equivalent to this printer
          resolution attribute, false otherwise.

<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public final java.lang.Class<? extends javax.print.attribute.Attribute> javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterResolution.getCategory()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Get the printing attribute class which is to be used as the "category" 
 for this printing attribute value.
 <P>
 For class PrinterResolution, the category is class PrinterResolution itself. 

 @return  Printing attribute class (category), an instance of class
          {@link java.lang.Class java.lang.Class}.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public final java.lang.String javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterResolution.getName()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Get the name of the category of which this attribute value is an 
 instance. 
 <P>
 For class PrinterResolution, the 
 category name is <CODE>"printer-resolution"</CODE>.

 @return  Attribute category name.
