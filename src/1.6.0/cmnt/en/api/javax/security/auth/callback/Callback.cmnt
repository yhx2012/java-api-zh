public interface javax.security.auth.callback.Callback
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 <p> Implementations of this interface are passed to a
 <code>CallbackHandler</code>, allowing underlying security services
 the ability to interact with a calling application to retrieve specific
 authentication data such as usernames and passwords, or to display
 certain information, such as error and warning messages.

 <p> <code>Callback</code> implementations do not retrieve or
 display the information requested by underlying security services.
 <code>Callback</code> implementations simply provide the means
 to pass such requests to applications, and for applications,
 if appropriate, to return requested information back to the
 underlying security services.
