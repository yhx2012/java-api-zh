<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public interface javax.naming.Referenceable
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 This interface is implemented by an object that can provide a
 Reference to itself.
<p>
 A Reference represents a way of recording address information about
 objects which themselves are not directly bound to the naming system.
 Such objects can implement the Referenceable interface as a way
 for programs that use that object to determine what its Reference is.
 For example, when binding a object, if an object implements the
 Referenceable interface, getReference() can be invoked on the object to
 get its Reference to use for binding.
