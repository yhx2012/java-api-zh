public class java.awt.BasicStroke extends java.lang.Object implements java.awt.Stroke
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 The <code>BasicStroke</code> class defines a basic set of rendering
 attributes for the outlines of graphics primitives, which are rendered
 with a {@link Graphics2D} object that has its Stroke attribute set to 
 this <code>BasicStroke</code>.
 The rendering attributes defined by <code>BasicStroke</code> describe 
 the shape of the mark made by a pen drawn along the outline of a 
 {@link Shape} and the decorations applied at the ends and joins of 
 path segments of the <code>Shape</code>.
 These rendering attributes include:
 <dl compact>
 <dt><i>width</i>
 <dd>The pen width, measured perpendicularly to the pen trajectory.
 <dt><i>end caps</i>
 <dd>The decoration applied to the ends of unclosed subpaths and
 dash segments.  Subpaths that start and end on the same point are
 still considered unclosed if they do not have a CLOSE segment.
 See {@link java.awt.geom.PathIterator#SEG_CLOSE SEG_CLOSE}
 for more information on the CLOSE segment.
 The three different decorations are: {@link #CAP_BUTT},
 {@link #CAP_ROUND}, and {@link #CAP_SQUARE}.
 <dt><i>line joins</i>
 <dd>The decoration applied at the intersection of two path segments 
 and at the intersection of the endpoints of a subpath that is closed
 using {@link java.awt.geom.PathIterator#SEG_CLOSE SEG_CLOSE}.
 The three different decorations are: {@link #JOIN_BEVEL}, 
 {@link #JOIN_MITER}, and {@link #JOIN_ROUND}.
 <dt><i>miter limit</i>
 <dd>The limit to trim a line join that has a JOIN_MITER decoration.
 A line join is trimmed when the ratio of miter length to stroke
 width is greater than the miterlimit value.  The miter length is 
 the diagonal length of the miter, which is the distance between 
 the inside corner and the outside corner of the intersection.
 The smaller the angle formed by two line segments, the longer 
 the miter length and the sharper the angle of intersection.  The
 default miterlimit value of 10.0f causes all angles less than 
 11 degrees to be trimmed.  Trimming miters converts
 the decoration of the line join to bevel.
 <dt><i>dash attributes</i>
 <dd>The definition of how to make a dash pattern by alternating
 between opaque and transparent sections.
 </dl>
 All attributes that specify measurements and distances controlling
 the shape of the returned outline are measured in the same
 coordinate system as the original unstroked <code>Shape</code> 
 argument.  When a <code>Graphics2D</code> object uses a 
 <code>Stroke</code> object to redefine a path during the execution 
 of one of its <code>draw</code> methods, the geometry is supplied 
 in its original form before the <code>Graphics2D</code> transform 
 attribute is applied.  Therefore, attributes such as the pen width 
 are interpreted in the user space coordinate system of the 
 <code>Graphics2D</code> object and are subject to the scaling and 
 shearing effects of the user-space-to-device-space transform in that 
 particular <code>Graphics2D</code>.  
 For example, the width of a rendered shape's outline is determined
 not only by the width attribute of this <code>BasicStroke</code>, 
 but also by the transform attribute of the 
 <code>Graphics2D</code> object.  Consider this code:
 <blockquote><tt>
      // sets the Graphics2D object's Tranform attribute
	g2d.scale(10, 10);
      // sets the Graphics2D object's Stroke attribute
      g2d.setStroke(new BasicStroke(1.5f));
 </tt></blockquote>
 Assuming there are no other scaling transforms added to the 
 <code>Graphics2D</code> object, the resulting line 
 will be approximately 15 pixels wide. 
 As the example code demonstrates, a floating-point line 
 offers better precision, especially when large transforms are 
 used with a <code>Graphics2D</code> object.
 When a line is diagonal, the exact width depends on how the 
 rendering pipeline chooses which pixels to fill as it traces the 
 theoretical widened outline.  The choice of which pixels to turn 
 on is affected by the antialiasing attribute because the 
 antialiasing rendering pipeline can choose to color 
 partially-covered pixels.

 rendering process, see the <code>Graphics2D</code> class comments.
