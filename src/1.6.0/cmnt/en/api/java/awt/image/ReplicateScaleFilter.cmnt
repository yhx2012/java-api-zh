public class java.awt.image.ReplicateScaleFilter extends java.awt.image.ImageFilter
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 An ImageFilter class for scaling images using the simplest algorithm.
 This class extends the basic ImageFilter Class to scale an existing
 image and provide a source for a new image containing the resampled
 image.  The pixels in the source image are sampled to produce pixels
 for an image of the specified size by replicating rows and columns of
 pixels to scale up or omitting rows and columns of pixels to scale
 down.
 <p>It is meant to be used in conjunction with a FilteredImageSource
 object to produce scaled versions of existing images.  Due to
 implementation dependencies, there may be differences in pixel values 
 of an image filtered on different platforms.

public java.awt.image.ReplicateScaleFilter(int width, int height)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Constructs a ReplicateScaleFilter that scales the pixels from
 its source Image as specified by the width and height parameters.
 @param width the target width to scale the image
 @param height the target height to scale the image
 @throws IllegalArgumentException if <code>width</code> equals 
         zero or <code>height</code> equals zero

public void java.awt.image.ReplicateScaleFilter.setProperties(java.util.Hashtable<?, ?> props)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Passes along the properties from the source object after adding a
 property indicating the scale applied.
 This method invokes <code>super.setProperties</code>,
 which might result in additional properties being added.
 <p>
 Note: This method is intended to be called by the 
 <code>ImageProducer</code> of the <code>Image</code> whose pixels 
 are being filtered. Developers using
 this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling
 this method directly since that operation could interfere
 with the filtering operation.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void java.awt.image.ReplicateScaleFilter.setDimensions(int w, int h)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Override the dimensions of the source image and pass the dimensions
 of the new scaled size to the ImageConsumer.
 <p>
 Note: This method is intended to be called by the 
 <code>ImageProducer</code> of the <code>Image</code> whose pixels 
 are being filtered. Developers using
 this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling
 this method directly since that operation could interfere
 with the filtering operation.

 Choose which rows and columns of the delivered byte pixels are
 needed for the destination scaled image and pass through just
 those rows and columns that are needed, replicated as necessary.
