public class java.util.IdentityHashMap extends java.util.AbstractMap implements java.util.Map, java.io.Serializable, java.lang.Cloneable
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 This class implements the <tt>Map</tt> interface with a hash table, using
 reference-equality in place of object-equality when comparing keys (and
 values).  In other words, in an <tt>IdentityHashMap</tt>, two keys
 <tt>k1</tt> and <tt>k2</tt> are considered equal if and only if
 <tt>(k1==k2)</tt>.  (In normal <tt>Map</tt> implementations (like
 <tt>HashMap</tt>) two keys <tt>k1</tt> and <tt>k2</tt> are considered equal
 if and only if <tt>(k1==null ? k2==null : k1.equals(k2))</tt>.)

 <p><b>This class is <i>not</i> a general-purpose <tt>Map</tt>
 implementation!  While this class implements the <tt>Map</tt> interface, it
 intentionally violates <tt>Map's</tt> general contract, which mandates the
 use of the <tt>equals</tt> method when comparing objects.  This class is
 designed for use only in the rare cases wherein reference-equality
 semantics are required.</b>

 <p>A typical use of this class is <i>topology-preserving object graph
 transformations</i>, such as serialization or deep-copying.  To perform such
 a transformation, a program must maintain a "node table" that keeps track
 of all the object references that have already been processed.  The node
 table must not equate distinct objects even if they happen to be equal.
 Another typical use of this class is to maintain <i>proxy objects</i>.  For
 example, a debugging facility might wish to maintain a proxy object for
 each object in the program being debugged.

 <p>This class provides all of the optional map operations, and permits
 <tt>null</tt> values and the <tt>null</tt> key.  This class makes no
 guarantees as to the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee
 that the order will remain constant over time.

 <p>This class provides constant-time performance for the basic
 operations (<tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt>), assuming the system
 identity hash function ({@link System#identityHashCode(Object)})
 disperses elements properly among the buckets.

 <p>This class has one tuning parameter (which affects performance but not
 semantics): <i>expected maximum size</i>.  This parameter is the maximum
 number of key-value mappings that the map is expected to hold.  Internally,
 this parameter is used to determine the number of buckets initially
 comprising the hash table.  The precise relationship between the expected
 maximum size and the number of buckets is unspecified.

 <p>If the size of the map (the number of key-value mappings) sufficiently
 exceeds the expected maximum size, the number of buckets is increased
 Increasing the number of buckets ("rehashing") may be fairly expensive, so
 it pays to create identity hash maps with a sufficiently large expected
 maximum size.  On the other hand, iteration over collection views requires
 time proportional to the number of buckets in the hash table, so it
 pays not to set the expected maximum size too high if you are especially
 concerned with iteration performance or memory usage.

 <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 If multiple threads access an identity hash map concurrently, and at
 least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it <i>must</i>
 be synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is any operation
 that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value
 associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a
 structural modification.)  This is typically accomplished by
 synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.

 If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the
 {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap}
 method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 unsynchronized access to the map:<pre>
   Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new IdentityHashMap(...));</pre>

 <p>The iterators returned by the <tt>iterator</tt> method of the
 collections returned by all of this class's "collection view
 methods" are <i>fail-fast</i>: if the map is structurally modified
 at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except
 through the iterator's own <tt>remove</tt> method, the iterator
 will throw a {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the
 face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and
 cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior
 at an undetermined time in the future.

 <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
 Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 exception for its correctness: <i>fail-fast iterators should be used only
 to detect bugs.</i>

 <p>Implementation note: This is a simple <i>linear-probe</i> hash table,
 as described for example in texts by Sedgewick and Knuth.  The array
 alternates holding keys and values.  (This has better locality for large
 tables than does using separate arrays.)  For many JRE implementations
 and operation mixes, this class will yield better performance than
 {@link HashMap} (which uses <i>chaining</i> rather than linear-probing).

<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Constructs a new, empty map with the specified expected maximum size.
 Putting more than the expected number of key-value mappings into
 the map may cause the internal data structure to grow, which may be
 somewhat time-consuming.

<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public V java.util.IdentityHashMap.get(Object key)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped,
 or {@code null} if this map contains no mapping for the key.

 <p>More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key
 {@code k} to a value {@code v} such that {@code (key == k)},
 then this method returns {@code v}; otherwise it returns
 {@code null}.  (There can be at most one such mapping.)

 <p>A return value of {@code null} does not <i>necessarily</i>
 indicate that the map contains no mapping for the key; it's also
 possible that the map explicitly maps the key to {@code null}.
 The {@link #containsKey containsKey} operation may be used to
 distinguish these two cases.

 Removes all of the mappings from this map.

<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public boolean java.util.IdentityHashMap.equals(Object o)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Compares the specified object with this map for equality.  Returns
 <tt>true</tt> if the given object is also a map and the two maps
 represent identical object-reference mappings.  More formally, this
 map is equal to another map <tt>m</tt> if and only if
 <tt>this.entrySet().equals(m.entrySet())</tt>.

 <p><b>Owing to the reference-equality-based semantics of this map it is
 possible that the symmetry and transitivity requirements of the

 to a normal map.  However, the <tt>Object.equals</tt> contract is

 Returns the hash code value for this map.  The hash code of a map is
 defined to be the sum of the hash codes of each entry in the map's
 <tt>entrySet()</tt> view.  This ensures that <tt>m1.equals(m2)</tt>
 implies that <tt>m1.hashCode()==m2.hashCode()</tt> for any two
 <tt>IdentityHashMap</tt> instances <tt>m1</tt> and <tt>m2</tt>, as
 required by the general contract of {@link Object#hashCode}.

 <p><b>Owing to the reference-equality-based semantics of the
 <tt>Map.Entry</tt> instances in the set returned by this map's
 <tt>entrySet</tt> method, it is possible that the contractual
 requirement of <tt>Object.hashCode</tt> mentioned in the previous
 paragraph will be violated if one of the two objects being compared is
 an <tt>IdentityHashMap</tt> instance and the other is a normal map.</b>

 themselves are not cloned.

<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public java.util.Set<K> java.util.IdentityHashMap.keySet()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns an identity-based set view of the keys contained in this map.
 The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in
 the set, and vice-versa.  If the map is modified while an iteration
 over the set is in progress, the results of the iteration are
 undefined.  The set supports element removal, which removes the
 corresponding mapping from the map, via the <tt>Iterator.remove</tt>,
 <tt>Set.remove</tt>, <tt>removeAll</tt>, <tt>retainAll</tt>, and
 <tt>clear</tt> methods.  It does not support the <tt>add</tt> or
 <tt>addAll</tt> methods.

 <p><b>While the object returned by this method implements the
 <tt>Set</tt> interface, it does <i>not</i> obey <tt>Set's</tt> general
 contract.  Like its backing map, the set returned by this method
 defines element equality as reference-equality rather than
 object-equality.  This affects the behavior of its <tt>contains</tt>,
 <tt>remove</tt>, <tt>containsAll</tt>, <tt>equals</tt>, and
 <tt>hashCode</tt> methods.</b>

 <p><b>The <tt>equals</tt> method of the returned set returns <tt>true</tt>
 only if the specified object is a set containing exactly the same
 object references as the returned set.  The symmetry and transitivity
 requirements of the <tt>Object.equals</tt> contract may be violated if
 the set returned by this method is compared to a normal set.  However,
 the <tt>Object.equals</tt> contract is guaranteed to hold among sets
 returned by this method.</b>

 <p>The <tt>hashCode</tt> method of the returned set returns the sum of
 the <i>identity hashcodes</i> of the elements in the set, rather than
 the sum of their hashcodes.  This is mandated by the change in the
 semantics of the <tt>equals</tt> method, in order to enforce the
 general contract of the <tt>Object.hashCode</tt> method among sets
 returned by this method.

<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns a {@link Collection} view of the values contained in this map.
 The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
 reflected in the collection, and vice-versa.  If the map is
 modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress,
 the results of the iteration are undefined.  The collection
 supports element removal, which removes the corresponding

public java.util.Set<java.util.Map.Entry<K, V>> java.util.IdentityHashMap.entrySet()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns a {@link Set} view of the mappings contained in this map.
 Each element in the returned set is a reference-equality-based
 <tt>Map.Entry</tt>.  The set is backed by the map, so changes
 to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa.  If the
 map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress,
 the results of the iteration are undefined.  The set supports
 element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from
 the map, via the <tt>Iterator.remove</tt>, <tt>Set.remove</tt>,
 <tt>removeAll</tt>, <tt>retainAll</tt> and <tt>clear</tt>
 methods.  It does not support the <tt>add</tt> or
 <tt>addAll</tt> methods.

 <p>Like the backing map, the <tt>Map.Entry</tt> objects in the set
 returned by this method define key and value equality as
 reference-equality rather than object-equality.  This affects the
 behavior of the <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>hashCode</tt> methods of these
 <tt>Map.Entry</tt> objects.  A reference-equality based <tt>Map.Entry
 e</tt> is equal to an object <tt>o</tt> if and only if <tt>o</tt> is a
 <tt>Map.Entry</tt> and <tt>e.getKey()==o.getKey() &amp;&amp;
 e.getValue()==o.getValue()</tt>.  To accommodate these equals
 semantics, the <tt>hashCode</tt> method returns
 <tt>System.identityHashCode(e.getKey()) ^
 System.identityHashCode(e.getValue())</tt>.

 <p><b>Owing to the reference-equality-based semantics of the
 <tt>Map.Entry</tt> instances in the set returned by this method,
 it is possible that the symmetry and transitivity requirements of
 the {@link Object#equals(Object)} contract may be violated if any of
 the entries in the set is compared to a normal map entry, or if
 the set returned by this method is compared to a set of normal map
 entries (such as would be returned by a call to this method on a normal
 map).  However, the <tt>Object.equals</tt> contract is guaranteed to
 hold among identity-based map entries, and among sets of such entries.
