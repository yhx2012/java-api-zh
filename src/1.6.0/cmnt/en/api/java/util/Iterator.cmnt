<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public interface java.util.Iterator
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 An iterator over a collection.  Iterator takes the place of Enumeration in
 the Java collections framework.  Iterators differ from enumerations in two
 ways: <ul>
	<li> Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the
	     underlying collection during the iteration with well-defined
 	     semantics.
	<li> Method names have been improved.
 </ul><p>

 This interface is a member of the 
 <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 Java Collections Framework</a>.

<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public boolean java.util.Iterator.hasNext()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns <tt>true</tt> if the iteration has more elements. (In other
 words, returns <tt>true</tt> if <tt>next</tt> would return an element
 rather than throwing an exception.)

 @return <tt>true</tt> if the iterator has more elements.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public E java.util.Iterator.next()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns the next element in the iteration.

 @return the next element in the iteration.
 @exception NoSuchElementException iteration has no more elements.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void java.util.Iterator.remove()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 
 Removes from the underlying collection the last element returned by the
 iterator (optional operation).  This method can be called only once per
 call to <tt>next</tt>.  The behavior of an iterator is unspecified if
 the underlying collection is modified while the iteration is in
 progress in any way other than by calling this method.

 @exception UnsupportedOperationException if the <tt>remove</tt>
		  operation is not supported by this Iterator.

 @exception IllegalStateException if the <tt>next</tt> method has not
		  yet been called, or the <tt>remove</tt> method has already
		  been called after the last call to the <tt>next</tt>
		  method.
