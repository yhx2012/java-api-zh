<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 The <code>Properties</code> class represents a persistent set of
 properties. The <code>Properties</code> can be saved to a stream
 or loaded from a stream. Each key and its corresponding value in
 the property list is a string.
 <p>
 A property list can contain another property list as its
 "defaults"; this second property list is searched if
 the property key is not found in the original property list.
 <p>
 Because <code>Properties</code> inherits from <code>Hashtable</code>, the
 <code>put</code> and <code>putAll</code> methods can be applied to a
 <code>Properties</code> object.  Their use is strongly discouraged as they
 allow the caller to insert entries whose keys or values are not
 <code>Strings</code>.  The <code>setProperty</code> method should be used
 instead.  If the <code>store</code> or <code>save</code> method is called
 on a "compromised" <code>Properties</code> object that contains a
 non-<code>String</code> key or value, the call will fail. Similarly, 
 the call to the <code>propertyNames</code> or <code>list</code> method 
 will fail if it is called on a "compromised" <code>Properties</code> 
 object that contains a non-<code>String</code> key.

 <p>
 The {@link #load(java.io.Reader) load(Reader)} <tt>/</tt>
 {@link #store(java.io.Writer, java.lang.String) store(Writer, String)}
 methods load and store properties from and to a character based stream
 in a simple line-oriented format specified below.

 The {@link #load(java.io.InputStream) load(InputStream)} <tt>/</tt>
 {@link #store(java.io.OutputStream, java.lang.String) store(OutputStream, String)}
 methods work the same way as the load(Reader)/store(Writer, String) pair, except
 the input/output stream is encoded in ISO 8859-1 character encoding.
 Characters that cannot be directly represented in this encoding can be written using
 <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/lexical.html#3.3">Unicode escapes</a>
 ; only a single 'u' character is allowed in an escape
 sequence. The native2ascii tool can be used to convert property files to and
 from other character encodings.
 
 <p> The {@link #loadFromXML(InputStream)} and {@link
 #storeToXML(OutputStream, String, String)} methods load and store properties
 in a simple XML format.  By default the UTF-8 character encoding is used,
 however a specific encoding may be specified if required.  An XML properties
 document has the following DOCTYPE declaration:

 <pre>
 &lt;!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd"&gt;
 </pre>
 Note that the system URI (http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd) is
 <i>not</i> accessed when exporting or importing properties; it merely
 serves as a string to uniquely identify the DTD, which is:
 <pre>
    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

    &lt;!-- DTD for properties --&gt;

    &lt;!ELEMENT properties ( comment?, entry* ) &gt;

    &lt;!ATTLIST properties version CDATA #FIXED "1.0"&gt;

public synchronized void java.util.Properties.load(Reader reader) throws java.io.IOException
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Reads a property list (key and element pairs) from the input
 character stream in a simple line-oriented format.
 <p>
 Properties are processed in terms of lines. There are two
 kinds of line, <i>natural lines</i> and <i>logical lines</i>.
 A natural line is defined as a line of
 characters that is terminated either by a set of line terminator
 characters (<code>\n</code> or <code>\r</code> or <code>\r\n</code>)
 or by the end of the stream. A natural line may be either a blank line,
 a comment line, or hold all or some of a key-element pair. A logical
 line holds all the data of a key-element pair, which may be spread
 out across several adjacent natural lines by escaping
 the line terminator sequence with a backslash character
 <code>\</code>.  Note that a comment line cannot be extended
 in this manner; every natural line that is a comment must have
 its own comment indicator, as described below. Lines are read from
 input until the end of the stream is reached.

 <p>
 A natural line that contains only white space characters is
 considered blank and is ignored.  A comment line has an ASCII
 <code>'#'</code> or <code>'!'</code> as its first non-white
 space character; comment lines are also ignored and do not
 encode key-element information.  In addition to line
 terminators, this format considers the characters space
 (<code>' '</code>, <code>'&#92;u0020'</code>), tab
 (<code>'\t'</code>, <code>'&#92;u0009'</code>), and form feed
 (<code>'\f'</code>, <code>'&#92;u000C'</code>) to be white
 space.

 <p>
 If a logical line is spread across several natural lines, the
 backslash escaping the line terminator sequence, the line
 terminator sequence, and any white space at the start of the
 following line have no affect on the key or element values.
 The remainder of the discussion of key and element parsing
 (when loading) will assume all the characters constituting
 the key and element appear on a single natural line after
 line continuation characters have been removed.  Note that
 it is <i>not</i> sufficient to only examine the character
 preceding a line terminator sequence to decide if the line
 terminator is escaped; there must be an odd number of
 contiguous backslashes for the line terminator to be escaped.
 Since the input is processed from left to right, a
 non-zero even number of 2<i>n</i> contiguous backslashes
 before a line terminator (or elsewhere) encodes <i>n</i>
 backslashes after escape processing.

 <p>
 The key contains all of the characters in the line starting
 with the first non-white space character and up to, but not
 including, the first unescaped <code>'='</code>,
 <code>':'</code>, or white space character other than a line
 terminator. All of these key termination characters may be
 included in the key by escaping them with a preceding backslash
 character; for example,<p>

 <code>\:\=</code><p>

 would be the two-character key <code>":="</code>.  Line
 terminator characters can be included using <code>\r</code> and
 <code>\n</code> escape sequences.  Any white space after the
 key is skipped; if the first non-white space character after
 the key is <code>'='</code> or <code>':'</code>, then it is
 ignored and any white space characters after it are also
 skipped.  All remaining characters on the line become part of
 the associated element string; if there are no remaining
 characters, the element is the empty string
 <code>&quot;&quot;</code>.  Once the raw character sequences
 constituting the key and element are identified, escape
 processing is performed as described above.

 <p>
 As an example, each of the following three lines specifies the key
 <code>"Truth"</code> and the associated element value
 <code>"Beauty"</code>:
 <p>
 <pre>
 Truth = Beauty
	Truth:Beauty
 Truth			:Beauty
 </pre>
 As another example, the following three lines specify a single
 property:
 <p>
 <pre>
 fruits                           apple, banana, pear, \
                                  cantaloupe, watermelon, \
                                  kiwi, mango
 </pre>
 The key is <code>"fruits"</code> and the associated element is:
 <p>
 <pre>"apple, banana, pear, cantaloupe, watermelon, kiwi, mango"</pre>
 Note that a space appears before each <code>\</code> so that a space
 will appear after each comma in the final result; the <code>\</code>,
 line terminator, and leading white space on the continuation line are
 merely discarded and are <i>not</i> replaced by one or more other
 characters.
 <p>
 As a third example, the line:
 <p>
 <pre>cheeses
 </pre>
 specifies that the key is <code>"cheeses"</code> and the associated
 element is the empty string <code>""</code>.<p>
 <p>

 <a name="unicodeescapes"></a>
 Characters in keys and elements can be represented in escape
 sequences similar to those used for character and string literals
 (see <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/lexical.html#3.3">&sect;3.3</a>
 and <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/lexical.html#3.10.6">&sect;3.10.6</a>
 of the <i>Java Language Specification</i>).

 The differences from the character escape sequences and Unicode
 escapes used for characters and strings are:

 <ul>
 <li> Octal escapes are not recognized.

 <li> The character sequence <code>\b</code> does <i>not</i>
 represent a backspace character.

 <li> The method does not treat a backslash character,
 <code>\</code>, before a non-valid escape character as an
 error; the backslash is silently dropped.  For example, in a
 Java string the sequence <code>"\z"</code> would cause a
 compile time error.  In contrast, this method silently drops
 the backslash.  Therefore, this method treats the two character
 sequence <code>"\b"</code> as equivalent to the single
 character <code>'b'</code>.

 <li> Escapes are not necessary for single and double quotes;
 however, by the rule above, single and double quote characters
 preceded by a backslash still yield single and double quote
 characters, respectively.

 <li> Only a single 'u' character is allowed in a Uniocde escape
 sequence.

 </ul>

 The specified stream remains open after this method returns.

 @param   reader   the input character stream.
 @throws  IOException  if an error occurred when reading from the

 format as specified in
 {@link #load(java.io.Reader) load(Reader)} and is assumed to use

 Calls the <code>store(OutputStream out, String comments)</code> method
 and suppresses IOExceptions that were thrown.

 @deprecated This method does not throw an IOException if an I/O error
 occurs while saving the property list.  The preferred way to save a
 properties list is via the <code>store(OutputStream out, 
 String comments)</code> method or the 
 <code>storeToXML(OutputStream os, String comment)</code> method.

 @param   out      an output stream.
 @param   comments   a description of the property list.
 @exception  ClassCastException  if this <code>Properties</code> object
             contains any keys or values that are not

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void java.util.Properties.store(Writer writer, String comments) throws java.io.IOException
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Writes this property list (key and element pairs) in this
 <code>Properties</code> table to the output character stream in a 
 format suitable for using the {@link #load(java.io.Reader) load(Reader)}
 method.
 <p>
 Properties from the defaults table of this <code>Properties</code>
 table (if any) are <i>not</i> written out by this method.
 <p>
 If the comments argument is not null, then an ASCII <code>#</code>
 character, the comments string, and a line separator are first written
 to the output stream. Thus, the <code>comments</code> can serve as an
 identifying comment. Any one of a line feed ('\n'), a carriage
 return ('\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed
 in comments is replaced by a line separator generated by the <code>Writer</code>
 and if the next character in comments is not character <code>#</code> or 
 character <code>!</code> then an ASCII <code>#</code> is written out 
 after that line separator.
 <p>
 Next, a comment line is always written, consisting of an ASCII
 <code>#</code> character, the current date and time (as if produced
 by the <code>toString</code> method of <code>Date</code> for the
 current time), and a line separator as generated by the <code>Writer</code>.
 <p>
 Then every entry in this <code>Properties</code> table is
 written out, one per line. For each entry the key string is
 written, then an ASCII <code>=</code>, then the associated
 element string. For the key, all space characters are
 written with a preceding <code>\</code> character.  For the
 element, leading space characters, but not embedded or trailing
 space characters, are written with a preceding <code>\</code>
 character. The key and element characters <code>#</code>,
 <code>!</code>, <code>=</code>, and <code>:</code> are written
 with a preceding backslash to ensure that they are properly loaded.
 <p>
 After the entries have been written, the output stream is flushed.  
 The output stream remains open after this method returns.
 <p>

 @param   writer      an output character stream writer.
 @param   comments   a description of the property list.
 @exception  IOException if writing this property list to the specified
             output stream throws an <tt>IOException</tt>.
 @exception  ClassCastException  if this <code>Properties</code> object
