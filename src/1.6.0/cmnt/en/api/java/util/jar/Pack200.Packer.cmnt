public static interface java.util.jar.Pack200.Packer
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 The packer engine applies various transformations to the input JAR file,
 making the pack stream highly compressible by a compressor such as
 gzip or zip. An instance of the engine can be obtained
 using {@link #newPacker}.

 The high degree of compression is achieved
 by using a number of techniques described in the JSR 200 specification.
 Some of the techniques are sorting, re-ordering and co-location of the
 constant pool.
 <p>
 The pack engine is initialized to an initial state as described
 by their properties below.
 The initial state can be manipulated by getting the
 engine properties (using {@link #properties}) and storing
 the modified properties on the map.
 The resource files will be passed through with no changes at all.
 The class files will not contain identical bytes, since the unpacker
 is free to change minor class file features such as constant pool order.
 However, the class files will be semantically identical,
 as specified in the Java Virtual Machine Specification
 <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/html/ClassFile.doc.html">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/html/ClassFile.doc.html</a>.
 <p>
 By default, the packer does not change the order of JAR elements.
 Also, the modification time and deflation hint of each
 JAR element is passed unchanged.
 (Any other ZIP-archive information, such as extra attributes
 giving Unix file permissions, are lost.)
 <p>
 Note that packing and unpacking a JAR will in general alter the
 bytewise contents of classfiles in the JAR.  This means that packing
 and unpacking will in general invalidate any digital signatures
 which rely on bytewise images of JAR elements.  In order both to sign
 and to pack a JAR, you must first pack and unpack the JAR to
 "normalize" it, then compute signatures on the unpacked JAR elements,
 and finally repack the signed JAR.
 Both packing steps should
 use precisely the same options, and the segment limit may also
 need to be set to "-1", to prevent accidental variation of segment
 boundaries as class file sizes change slightly.
 <p>
 (Here's why this works:  Any reordering the packer does
 of any classfile structures is idempotent, so the second packing
 does not change the orderings produced by the first packing.
 Also, the unpacker is guaranteed by the JSR 200 specification
 to produce a specific bytewise image for any given transmission
 ordering of archive elements.)
 <p>
 In order to maintain backward compatibility, if the input JAR-files are 
 solely comprised of 1.5 (or  lesser) classfiles, a 1.5 compatible 
 pack file is  produced.  Otherwise a 1.6 compatible pack200 file is 
 produced.
 <p>     
 @since 1.5

<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public static final java.lang.String java.util.jar.Pack200.Packer.SEGMENT_LIMIT
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 This property is a numeral giving the estimated target size N
 (in bytes) of each archive segment.
 If a single input file requires more than N bytes,
 it will be given its own archive segment.
 <p>
 As a special case, a value of -1 will produce a single large
 segment with all input files, while a value of 0 will
 produce one segment for each class.
 Larger archive segments result in less fragmentation and
 better compression, but processing them requires more memory.
 <p>
 The size of each segment is estimated by counting the size of each
 input file to be transmitted in the segment, along with the size
 of its name and other transmitted properties.
 <p>
 The default is 1000000 (a million bytes).  This allows input JAR files
 of moderate size to be transmitted in one segment.  It also puts
 a limit on memory requirements for packers and unpackers.
 <p>
 A 10Mb JAR packed without this limit will
 typically pack about 10% smaller, but the packer may require
 a larger Java heap (about ten times the segment limit).

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public static final java.lang.String java.util.jar.Pack200.Packer.KEEP_FILE_ORDER
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 If this property is set to {@link #TRUE}, the packer will transmit
 all elements in their original order within the source archive.
 <p>
 If it is set to {@link #FALSE}, the packer may reorder elements,
 and also remove JAR directory entries, which carry no useful
 information for Java applications.
 (Typically this enables better compression.)
 <p>
 The default is {@link #TRUE}, which preserves the input information,
 but may cause the transmitted archive to be larger than necessary.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public static final java.lang.String java.util.jar.Pack200.Packer.EFFORT
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 If this property is set to a single decimal digit, the packer will
 use the indicated amount of effort in compressing the archive.
 Level 1 may produce somewhat larger size and faster compression speed,
 while level 9 will take much longer but may produce better compression.
 <p>
 The special value 0 instructs the packer to copy through the
 original JAR file directly, with no compression.  The JSR 200
 standard requires any unpacker to understand this special case
 as a pass-through of the entire archive.
 <p>
 The default is 5, investing a modest amount of time to
 produce reasonable compression.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public static final java.lang.String java.util.jar.Pack200.Packer.DEFLATE_HINT
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 If this property is set to {@link #TRUE} or {@link #FALSE}, the packer
 will set the deflation hint accordingly in the output archive, and
 will not transmit the individual deflation hints of archive elements.
 <p>
 If this property is set to the special string {@link #KEEP}, the packer
 will attempt to determine an independent deflation hint for each
 available element of the input archive, and transmit this hint separately.
 <p>
 The default is {@link #KEEP}, which preserves the input information,
 but may cause the transmitted archive to be larger than necessary.
 <p>
 It is up to the unpacker implementation
 to take action upon the hint to suitably compress the elements of
 the resulting unpacked jar.
 <p>
 The deflation hint of a ZIP or JAR element indicates
 whether the element was deflated or stored directly.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public static final java.lang.String java.util.jar.Pack200.Packer.MODIFICATION_TIME
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 If this property is set to the special string {@link #LATEST},
 the packer will attempt to determine the latest modification time,
 among all the available entries in the original archive or the latest
 modification time of all the available entries in each segment.
 This single value will be transmitted as part of the segment and applied
 to all the entries in each segment, {@link #SEGMENT_LIMIT}.
 <p>
 This can marginally decrease the transmitted size of the
 archive, at the expense of setting all installed files to a single
 date.
 <p>
 If this property is set to the special string {@link #KEEP},
 the packer transmits a separate modification time for each input
 element.
 <p>
 The default is {@link #KEEP}, which preserves the input information,
 but may cause the transmitted archive to be larger than necessary.
 <p>
 It is up to the unpacker implementation to take action to suitably
 set the modification time of each element of its output file.

<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public static final java.lang.String java.util.jar.Pack200.Packer.PASS_FILE_PFX
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Indicates that a file should be passed through bytewise, with no
 compression.  Multiple files may be specified by specifying
 additional properties with distinct strings appended, to
 make a family of properties with the common prefix.
 <p>
 There is no pathname transformation, except
 that the system file separator is replaced by the JAR file
 separator '/'.
 <p>
 The resulting file names must match exactly as strings with their
 occurrences in the JAR file.
 <p>
 If a property value is a directory name, all files under that
 directory will be passed also.
 <p>
 Examples:
 <pre><code>
     Map p = packer.properties();
     p.put(PASS_FILE_PFX+0, "mutants/Rogue.class");
     p.put(PASS_FILE_PFX+1, "mutants/Wolverine.class");
     p.put(PASS_FILE_PFX+2, "mutants/Storm.class");
     # Pass all files in an entire directory hierarchy:
     p.put(PASS_FILE_PFX+3, "police/");
 </pre></code>.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public static final java.lang.String java.util.jar.Pack200.Packer.UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Indicates the action to take when a class-file containing an unknown
 attribute is encountered.  Possible values are the strings {@link #ERROR},
 {@link #STRIP}, and {@link #PASS}.
 <p>
 The string {@link #ERROR} means that the pack operation
 as a whole will fail, with an exception of type <code>IOException</code>.
 The string
 {@link #STRIP} means that the attribute will be dropped.
 The string
 {@link #PASS} means that the whole class-file will be passed through
 (as if it were a resource file) without compression, with  a suitable warning.
 This is the default value for this property.
 <p>
 Examples:
 <pre><code>
     Map p = pack200.getProperties();
     p.put(UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE, ERROR);
     p.put(UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE, STRIP);
     p.put(UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE, PASS);
 </pre></code>

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public static final java.lang.String java.util.jar.Pack200.Packer.CLASS_ATTRIBUTE_PFX
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 When concatenated with a class attribute name,
 indicates the format of that attribute,
 using the layout language specified in the JSR 200 specification.
 <p>
 For example, the effect of this option is built in:
 <code>pack.class.attribute.SourceFile=RUH</code>.
 <p>
 The special strings {@link #ERROR}, {@link #STRIP}, and {@link #PASS} are
 also allowed, with the same meaning as {@link #UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE}.
 This provides a way for users to request that specific attributes be
 refused, stripped, or passed bitwise (with no class compression).
 <p>
 Code like this might be used to support attributes for JCOV:
 <pre><code>
     Map p = packer.properties();
     p.put(CODE_ATTRIBUTE_PFX+"CoverageTable",       "NH[PHHII]");
     p.put(CODE_ATTRIBUTE_PFX+"CharacterRangeTable", "NH[PHPOHIIH]");
     p.put(CLASS_ATTRIBUTE_PFX+"SourceID",           "RUH");
     p.put(CLASS_ATTRIBUTE_PFX+"CompilationID",      "RUH");
 </code></pre>
 <p>
 Code like this might be used to strip debugging attributes:
 <pre><code>
     Map p = packer.properties();
     p.put(CODE_ATTRIBUTE_PFX+"LineNumberTable",    STRIP);
     p.put(CODE_ATTRIBUTE_PFX+"LocalVariableTable", STRIP);
     p.put(CLASS_ATTRIBUTE_PFX+"SourceFile",        STRIP);
 </code></pre>
