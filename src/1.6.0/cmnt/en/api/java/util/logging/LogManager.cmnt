<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 There is a single global LogManager object that is used to
 maintain a set of shared state about Loggers and log services.
 <p>
 This LogManager object:
 <ul>
 <li> Manages a hierarchical namespace of Logger objects.  All
      named Loggers are stored in this namespace.
 <li> Manages a set of logging control properties.  These are
      simple key-value pairs that can be used by Handlers and
      other logging objects to configure themselves.
 </ul>
 <p>
 The global LogManager object can be retrieved using LogManager.getLogManager().
 The LogManager object is created during class initialization and
 cannot subsequently be changed.
 <p>
 At startup the LogManager class is located using the 
 java.util.logging.manager system property.
 <p>
 By default, the LogManager reads its initial configuration from 
 a properties file "lib/logging.properties" in the JRE directory.
 If you edit that property file you can change the default logging
 configuration for all uses of that JRE.
 <p>
 In addition, the LogManager uses two optional system properties that
 allow more control over reading the initial configuration:
 <ul>
 <li>"java.util.logging.config.class"
 <li>"java.util.logging.config.file"
 </ul>
 These two properties may be set via the Preferences API, or as
 command line property definitions to the "java" command, or as
 system property definitions passed to JNI_CreateJavaVM.
 <p>
 If the "java.util.logging.config.class" property is set, then the
 property value is treated as a class name.  The given class will be
 loaded, an object will be instantiated, and that object's constructor
 is responsible for reading in the initial configuration.  (That object
 may use other system properties to control its configuration.)  The
 alternate configuration class can use <tt>readConfiguration(InputStream)</tt>
 to define properties in the LogManager.
 <p>
 If "java.util.logging.config.class" property is <b>not</b> set,
 then the "java.util.logging.config.file" system property can be used
 to specify a properties file (in java.util.Properties format). The
 initial logging configuration will be read from this file.
 <p>
 If neither of these properties is defined then, as described
 above, the LogManager will read its initial configuration from 
 a properties file "lib/logging.properties" in the JRE directory.
 <p>
 The properties for loggers and Handlers will have names starting
 with the dot-separated name for the handler or logger.
 <p>
 The global logging properties may include:
 <ul>
 <li>A property "handlers".  This defines a whitespace or comma separated
 list of class names for handler classes to load and register as
 handlers on the root Logger (the Logger named "").  Each class
 name must be for a Handler class which has a default constructor.
 Note that these Handlers may be created lazily, when they are
 first used.

 <li>A property "&lt;logger&gt;.handlers". This defines a whitespace or
 comma separated list of class names for handlers classes to
 load and register as handlers to the specified logger. Each class
 name must be for a Handler class which has a default constructor.
 Note that these Handlers may be created lazily, when they are
 first used.

 <li>A property "&lt;logger&gt;.useParentHandlers". This defines a boolean
 value. By default every logger calls its parent in addition to
 handling the logging message itself, this often result in messages
 being handled by the root logger as well. When setting this property
 to false a Handler needs to be configured for this logger otherwise
 no logging messages are delivered.

 <li>A property "config".  This property is intended to allow
 arbitrary configuration code to be run.  The property defines a
 whitespace or comma separated list of class names.  A new instance will be
 created for each named class.  The default constructor of each class
 may execute arbitrary code to update the logging configuration, such as
 setting logger levels, adding handlers, adding filters, etc.
 </ul>
 <p>
 Note that all classes loaded during LogManager configuration are
 first searched on the system class path before any user class path.  
 That includes the LogManager class, any config classes, and any 
 handler classes.
 <p>
 Loggers are organized into a naming hierarchy based on their
 dot separated names.  Thus "a.b.c" is a child of "a.b", but
 "a.b1" and a.b2" are peers.
 <p>
 All properties whose names end with ".level" are assumed to define
 log levels for Loggers.  Thus "foo.level" defines a log level for
 the logger called "foo" and (recursively) for any of its children
 in the naming hierarchy.  Log Levels are applied in the order they 
 are defined in the properties file.  Thus level settings for child
 nodes in the tree should come after settings for their parents.
 The property name ".level" can be used to set the level for the
 root of the tree.
 <p> 
 All methods on the LogManager object are multi-thread safe.

protected java.util.logging.LogManager()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->

 Protected constructor.  This is protected so that container applications
 (such as J2EE containers) can subclass the object.  It is non-public as
 it is intended that there only be one LogManager object, whose value is
 retrieved by calling Logmanager.getLogManager.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public static java.util.logging.LogManager java.util.logging.LogManager.getLogManager()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Return the global LogManager object.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void java.util.logging.LogManager.addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener l) throws java.lang.SecurityException
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Adds an event listener to be invoked when the logging
 properties are re-read. Adding multiple instances of
 the same event Listener results in multiple entries
 in the property event listener table.

 @param l  event listener
 @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and if
             the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
 @exception NullPointerException if the PropertyChangeListener is null.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void java.util.logging.LogManager.removePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener l) throws java.lang.SecurityException
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Removes an event listener for property change events.
 If the same listener instance has been added to the listener table
 through multiple invocations of <CODE>addPropertyChangeListener</CODE>,
 then an equivalent number of 
 <CODE>removePropertyChangeListener</CODE> invocations are required to remove
 all instances of that listener from the listener table.
 <P>
 Returns silently if the given listener is not found.
 
 @param l  event listener (can be null)
 @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and if
             the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public synchronized boolean java.util.logging.LogManager.addLogger(Logger logger)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Add a named logger.  This does nothing and returns false if a logger
 with the same name is already registered.
 <p>
 The Logger factory methods call this method to register each
 newly created Logger.
 <p>
 The application should retain its own reference to the Logger 
 object to avoid it being garbage collected.  The LogManager
 may only retain a weak reference.

 @param   logger the new logger.
 @return  true if the argument logger was registered successfully,
          false if a logger of that name already exists.
 @exception NullPointerException if the logger name is null.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public synchronized java.util.logging.Logger java.util.logging.LogManager.getLogger(String name)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Method to find a named logger.
 <p>
 Note that since untrusted code may create loggers with
 arbitrary names this method should not be relied on to
 find Loggers for security sensitive logging.
 <p>
 @param name name of the logger 
 @return  matching logger or null if none is found

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public synchronized java.util.Enumeration<java.lang.String> java.util.logging.LogManager.getLoggerNames()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Get an enumeration of known logger names.

 Note:  Loggers may be added dynamically as new classes are loaded.
 This method only reports on the loggers that are currently registered.
 <p>
 @return  enumeration of logger name strings

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void java.util.logging.LogManager.readConfiguration() throws java.io.IOException, java.lang.SecurityException
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Reinitialize the logging properties and reread the logging configuration.
 <p>
 The same rules are used for locating the configuration properties
 as are used at startup.  So normally the logging properties will
 be re-read from the same file that was used at startup.
 <P>
 Any log level definitions in the new configuration file will be 
 applied using Logger.setLevel(), if the target Logger exists.
 <p>
 A PropertyChangeEvent will be fired after the properties are read.
 
 @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and if
             the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
 @exception  IOException if there are IO problems reading the configuration.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void java.util.logging.LogManager.reset() throws java.lang.SecurityException
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Reset the logging configuration.
 <p>
 For all named loggers, the reset operation removes and closes
 all Handlers and (except for the root logger) sets the level
 to null.  The root logger's level is set to Level.INFO.

 @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and if
             the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void java.util.logging.LogManager.readConfiguration(InputStream ins) throws java.io.IOException, java.lang.SecurityException
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Reinitialize the logging properties and reread the logging configuration
 from the given stream, which should be in java.util.Properties format.
 A PropertyChangeEvent will be fired after the properties are read.
 <p>
 Any log level definitions in the new configuration file will be 
 applied using Logger.setLevel(), if the target Logger exists.
 
 @param ins	stream to read properties from
 @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and if
             the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
 @exception  IOException if there are problems reading from the stream.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public java.lang.String java.util.logging.LogManager.getProperty(String name)

 @return		property value

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void java.util.logging.LogManager.checkAccess() throws java.lang.SecurityException
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Check that the current context is trusted to modify the logging
 configuration.  This requires LoggingPermission("control").
 <p>
 If the check fails we throw a SecurityException, otherwise
 we return normally.

 @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and if
             the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
