public abstract class java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer extends java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractOwnableSynchronizer implements java.io.Serializable
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Provides a framework for implementing blocking locks and related
 synchronizers (semaphores, events, etc) that rely on
 first-in-first-out (FIFO) wait queues.  This class is designed to
 be a useful basis for most kinds of synchronizers that rely on a
 single atomic <tt>int</tt> value to represent state. Subclasses
 must define the protected methods that change this state, and which
 define what that state means in terms of this object being acquired
 or released.  Given these, the other methods in this class carry
 out all queuing and blocking mechanics. Subclasses can maintain
 other state fields, but only the atomically updated <tt>int</tt>
 value manipulated using methods {@link #getState}, {@link
 #setState} and {@link #compareAndSetState} is tracked with respect
 to synchronization.

 <p>Subclasses should be defined as non-public internal helper
 classes that are used to implement the synchronization properties
 of their enclosing class.  Class
 <tt>AbstractQueuedSynchronizer</tt> does not implement any
 synchronization interface.  Instead it defines methods such as
 {@link #acquireInterruptibly} that can be invoked as
 appropriate by concrete locks and related synchronizers to
 implement their public methods.

 <p>This class supports either or both a default <em>exclusive</em>
 mode and a <em>shared</em> mode. When acquired in exclusive mode,
 attempted acquires by other threads cannot succeed. Shared mode
 acquires by multiple threads may (but need not) succeed. This class
 does not &quot;understand&quot; these differences except in the
 mechanical sense that when a shared mode acquire succeeds, the next
 waiting thread (if one exists) must also determine whether it can
 acquire as well. Threads waiting in the different modes share the
 same FIFO queue. Usually, implementation subclasses support only
 one of these modes, but both can come into play for example in a
 {@link ReadWriteLock}. Subclasses that support only exclusive or
 only shared modes need not define the methods supporting the unused mode.

 <p>This class defines a nested {@link ConditionObject} class that
 can be used as a {@link Condition} implementation by subclasses
 supporting exclusive mode for which method {@link
 #isHeldExclusively} reports whether synchronization is exclusively
 held with respect to the current thread, method {@link #release}
 invoked with the current {@link #getState} value fully releases
 this object, and {@link #acquire}, given this saved state value,
 eventually restores this object to its previous acquired state.  No
 <tt>AbstractQueuedSynchronizer</tt> method otherwise creates such a
 condition, so if this constraint cannot be met, do not use it.  The
 behavior of {@link ConditionObject} depends of course on the
 semantics of its synchronizer implementation.

 <p>This class provides inspection, instrumentation, and monitoring
 methods for the internal queue, as well as similar methods for
 condition objects. These can be exported as desired into classes
 using an <tt>AbstractQueuedSynchronizer</tt> for their
 synchronization mechanics.

 <p>Serialization of this class stores only the underlying atomic
 integer maintaining state, so deserialized objects have empty
 thread queues. Typical subclasses requiring serializability will
 define a <tt>readObject</tt> method that restores this to a known
 initial state upon deserialization.

 <h3>Usage</h3>

 <p>To use this class as the basis of a synchronizer, redefine the
 following methods, as applicable, by inspecting and/or modifying
 the synchronization state using {@link #getState}, {@link
 #setState} and/or {@link #compareAndSetState}:

 <ul>
 <li> {@link #tryAcquire}
 <li> {@link #tryRelease}
 <li> {@link #tryAcquireShared}
 <li> {@link #tryReleaseShared}
 <li> {@link #isHeldExclusively}
</ul>

 Each of these methods by default throws {@link
 UnsupportedOperationException}.  Implementations of these methods
 must be internally thread-safe, and should in general be short and
 not block. Defining these methods is the <em>only</em> supported
 means of using this class. All other methods are declared
 <tt>final</tt> because they cannot be independently varied.

 <p>You may also find the inherited methods from {@link
 AbstractOwnableSynchronizer} useful to keep track of the thread
 owning an exclusive synchronizer.  You are encouraged to use them
 -- this enables monitoring and diagnostic tools to assist users in
 determining which threads hold locks.

 <p>Even though this class is based on an internal FIFO queue, it
 does not automatically enforce FIFO acquisition policies.  The core
 of exclusive synchronization takes the form:

 <pre>
 Acquire:
     while (!tryAcquire(arg)) {
        <em>enqueue thread if it is not already queued</em>;
        <em>possibly block current thread</em>;
     }

 Release:
     if (tryRelease(arg))
        <em>unblock the first queued thread</em>;
 </pre>

 (Shared mode is similar but may involve cascading signals.)

 <p>Because checks in acquire are invoked before enqueuing, a newly
 acquiring thread may <em>barge</em> ahead of others that are
 blocked and queued. However, you can, if desired, define
 <tt>tryAcquire</tt> and/or <tt>tryAcquireShared</tt> to disable
 barging by internally invoking one or more of the inspection
 methods. In particular, a strict FIFO lock can define
 <tt>tryAcquire</tt> to immediately return <tt>false</tt> if {@link
 #getFirstQueuedThread} does not return the current thread.  A
 normally preferable non-strict fair version can immediately return
 <tt>false</tt> only if {@link #hasQueuedThreads} returns
 <tt>true</tt> and <tt>getFirstQueuedThread</tt> is not the current
 thread; or equivalently, that <tt>getFirstQueuedThread</tt> is both
 non-null and not the current thread.  Further variations are
 possible.

 <p>Throughput and scalability are generally highest for the
 default barging (also known as <em>greedy</em>,
 <em>renouncement</em>, and <em>convoy-avoidance</em>) strategy.
 While this is not guaranteed to be fair or starvation-free, earlier
 queued threads are allowed to recontend before later queued
 threads, and each recontention has an unbiased chance to succeed
 against incoming threads.  Also, while acquires do not
 &quot;spin&quot; in the usual sense, they may perform multiple
 invocations of <tt>tryAcquire</tt> interspersed with other
 computations before blocking.  This gives most of the benefits of
 spins when exclusive synchronization is only briefly held, without
 most of the liabilities when it isn't. If so desired, you can
 augment this by preceding calls to acquire methods with
 "fast-path" checks, possibly prechecking {@link #hasContended}
 and/or {@link #hasQueuedThreads} to only do so if the synchronizer
 is likely not to be contended.

 <p>This class provides an efficient and scalable basis for
 synchronization in part by specializing its range of use to
 synchronizers that can rely on <tt>int</tt> state, acquire, and
 release parameters, and an internal FIFO wait queue. When this does
 not suffice, you can build synchronizers from a lower level using
 {@link java.util.concurrent.atomic atomic} classes, your own custom
 {@link java.util.Queue} classes, and {@link LockSupport} blocking
 support.

 <h3>Usage Examples</h3>

 <p>Here is a non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock class that uses
 the value zero to represent the unlocked state, and one to
 represent the locked state. While a non-reentrant lock
 does not strictly require recording of the current owner
 thread, this class does so anyway to make usage easier to monitor.
 It also supports conditions and exposes
 one of the instrumentation methods:

 <pre>
 class Mutex implements Lock, java.io.Serializable {

   // Our internal helper class
   private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer {
     // Report whether in locked state
     protected boolean isHeldExclusively() {
       return getState() == 1;
     }

     // Acquire the lock if state is zero
     public boolean tryAcquire(int acquires) {
       assert acquires == 1; // Otherwise unused
       if (compareAndSetState(0, 1)) {
         setExclusiveOwnerThread(Thread.currentThread());
         return true;
       }
       return false;
     }

     // Release the lock by setting state to zero
     protected boolean tryRelease(int releases) {
       assert releases == 1; // Otherwise unused
       if (getState() == 0) throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();
       setExclusiveOwnerThread(null);
       setState(0);
       return true;
     }

     // Provide a Condition
     Condition newCondition() { return new ConditionObject(); }

     // Deserialize properly
     private void readObject(ObjectInputStream s)
         throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
       s.defaultReadObject();
       setState(0); // reset to unlocked state
     }
   }

   // The sync object does all the hard work. We just forward to it.
   private final Sync sync = new Sync();

   public void lock()                { sync.acquire(1); }
   public boolean tryLock()          { return sync.tryAcquire(1); }
   public void unlock()              { sync.release(1); }
   public Condition newCondition()   { return sync.newCondition(); }
   public boolean isLocked()         { return sync.isHeldExclusively(); }
   public boolean hasQueuedThreads() { return sync.hasQueuedThreads(); }
   public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
     sync.acquireInterruptibly(1);
   }
   public boolean tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
       throws InterruptedException {
     return sync.tryAcquireNanos(1, unit.toNanos(timeout));
   }
 }
 </pre>

 <p>Here is a latch class that is like a {@link CountDownLatch}
 except that it only requires a single <tt>signal</tt> to
 fire. Because a latch is non-exclusive, it uses the <tt>shared</tt>
 acquire and release methods.

 <pre>
 class BooleanLatch {

   private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer {
     boolean isSignalled() { return getState() != 0; }

     protected int tryAcquireShared(int ignore) {
       return isSignalled()? 1 : -1;
     }

     protected boolean tryReleaseShared(int ignore) {
       setState(1);
       return true;
     }
   }

   private final Sync sync = new Sync();
   public boolean isSignalled() { return sync.isSignalled(); }
   public void signal()         { sync.releaseShared(1); }
   public void await() throws InterruptedException {
     sync.acquireSharedInterruptibly(1);
   }
 }
 </pre>

 Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting on the

 because timeouts and interrupts may occur at any time, the
 estimate serves only as an upper bound on the actual number of
 waiters.  This method is designed for use in monitoring of the
 system state, not for synchronization control.

 @param condition the condition
 @return the estimated number of waiting threads
 @throws IllegalMonitorStateException if exclusive synchronization
         is not held
 @throws IllegalArgumentException if the given condition is
         not associated with this synchronizer

<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns a collection containing those threads that may be
 waiting on the given condition associated with this
 synchronizer.  Because the actual set of threads may change
 dynamically while constructing this result, the returned
 collection is only a best-effort estimate. The elements of the
 returned collection are in no particular order.

 @param condition the condition
 @return the collection of threads
 @throws IllegalMonitorStateException if exclusive synchronization
         is not held
 @throws IllegalArgumentException if the given condition is
         not associated with this synchronizer
 @throws NullPointerException if the condition is null
