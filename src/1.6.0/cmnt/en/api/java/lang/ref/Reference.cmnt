public abstract class java.lang.ref.Reference extends java.lang.Object
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Abstract base class for reference objects.  This class defines the
 operations common to all reference objects.	Because reference objects are
 implemented in close cooperation with the garbage collector, this class may
 not be subclassed directly.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public T java.lang.ref.Reference.get()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns this reference object's referent.  If this reference object has
 been cleared, either by the program or by the garbage collector, then
 this method returns <code>null</code>.

 @return	 The object to which this reference refers, or
		 <code>null</code> if this reference object has been cleared

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void java.lang.ref.Reference.clear()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Clears this reference object.  Invoking this method will not cause this
 object to be enqueued.

 <p> This method is invoked only by Java code; when the garbage collector
 clears references it does so directly, without invoking this method.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public boolean java.lang.ref.Reference.isEnqueued()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Tells whether or not this reference object has been enqueued, either by
 the program or by the garbage collector.	 If this reference object was
 not registered with a queue when it was created, then this method will
 always return <code>false</code>.

 @return	 <code>true</code> if and only if this reference object has
		 been enqueued

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public boolean java.lang.ref.Reference.enqueue()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Adds this reference object to the queue with which it is registered,
 if any.

 <p> This method is invoked only by Java code; when the garbage collector
 enqueues references it does so directly, without invoking this method.

 @return	 <code>true</code> if this reference object was successfully
		 enqueued; <code>false</code> if it was already enqueued or if
		 it was not registered with a queue when it was created

<!-- END DATA -->
