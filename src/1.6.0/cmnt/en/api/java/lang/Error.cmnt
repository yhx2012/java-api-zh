<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 An <code>Error</code> is a subclass of <code>Throwable</code> 
 that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application 
 should not try to catch. Most such errors are abnormal conditions. 
 The <code>ThreadDeath</code> error, though a "normal" condition,
 is also a subclass of <code>Error</code> because most applications
 should not try to catch it. 
 <p>
 A method is not required to declare in its <code>throws</code> 
 clause any subclasses of <code>Error</code> that might be thrown 
 during the execution of the method but not caught, since these 
 errors are abnormal conditions that should never occur.

<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public java.lang.Error()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Constructs a new error with <code>null</code> as its detail message.
 The cause is not initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by a
 call to {@link #initCause}.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public java.lang.Error(String message)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Constructs a new error with the specified detail message.  The
 cause is not initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by
 a call to {@link #initCause}.

 @param   message   the detail message. The detail message is saved for 
          later retrieval by the {@link #getMessage()} method.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public java.lang.Error(String message, Throwable cause)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Constructs a new error with the specified detail message and
 cause.  <p>Note that the detail message associated with
 <code>cause</code> is <i>not</i> automatically incorporated in
 this error's detail message.

 @param  message the detail message (which is saved for later retrieval
         by the {@link #getMessage()} method).
 @param  cause the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the
         {@link #getCause()} method).  (A <tt>null</tt> value is
         permitted, and indicates that the cause is nonexistent or
         unknown.)

<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public java.lang.Error(Throwable cause)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Constructs a new error with the specified cause and a detail
 message of <tt>(cause==null ? null : cause.toString())</tt> (which
 typically contains the class and detail message of <tt>cause</tt>).
 This constructor is useful for errors that are little more than
 wrappers for other throwables.

 @param  cause the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the
         {@link #getCause()} method).  (A <tt>null</tt> value is
         permitted, and indicates that the cause is nonexistent or
         unknown.)
