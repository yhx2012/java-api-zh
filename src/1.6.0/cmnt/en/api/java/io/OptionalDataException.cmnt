public class java.io.OptionalDataException extends java.io.ObjectStreamException
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Exception indicating the failure of an object read operation due to
 unread primitive data, or the end of data belonging to a serialized
 object in the stream.  This exception may be thrown in two cases:

 <ul>
   <li>An attempt was made to read an object when the next element in the
       stream is primitive data.  In this case, the OptionalDataException's
       length field is set to the number of bytes of primitive data
       immediately readable from the stream, and the eof field is set to
       false.

   <li>An attempt was made to read past the end of data consumable by a
       class-defined readObject or readExternal method.  In this case, the
       OptionalDataException's eof field is set to true, and the length field
       is set to 0.
 </ul>
