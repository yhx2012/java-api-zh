public interface java.security.acl.AclEntry extends java.lang.Cloneable
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 This is the interface used for representing one entry in an Access
 Control List (ACL).<p>

 An ACL can be thought of as a data structure with multiple ACL entry
 objects. Each ACL entry object contains a set of permissions associated
 with a particular principal. (A principal represents an entity such as
 an individual user or a group). Additionally, each ACL entry is specified
 as being either positive or negative. If positive, the permissions are
 to be granted to the associated principal. If negative, the permissions
 are to be denied. Each principal can have at most one positive ACL entry
 and one negative entry; that is, multiple positive or negative ACL
 entries are not allowed for any principal.

 Note: ACL entries are by default positive. An entry becomes a
 negative entry only if the
 {@link #setNegativePermissions() setNegativePermissions}
 method is called on it.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public boolean java.security.acl.AclEntry.setPrincipal(Principal user)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Specifies the principal for which permissions are granted or denied
 by this ACL entry. If a principal was already set for this ACL entry,
 false is returned, otherwise true is returned.

 @param user the principal to be set for this entry.

 @return true if the principal is set, false if there was
 already a principal set for this entry.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public java.security.Principal java.security.acl.AclEntry.getPrincipal()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns the principal for which permissions are granted or denied by
 this ACL entry. Returns null if there is no principal set for this
 entry yet.

 @return the principal associated with this entry.

 @see #setPrincipal

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void java.security.acl.AclEntry.setNegativePermissions()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Sets this ACL entry to be a negative one. That is, the associated
 principal (e.g., a user or a group) will be denied the permission set
 specified in the entry.

 Note: ACL entries are by default positive. An entry becomes a
 negative entry only if this <code>setNegativePermissions</code>
 method is called on it.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public boolean java.security.acl.AclEntry.isNegative()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns true if this is a negative ACL entry (one denying the
 associated principal the set of permissions in the entry), false
 otherwise.

 @return true if this is a negative ACL entry, false if it's not.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public boolean java.security.acl.AclEntry.addPermission(Permission permission)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Adds the specified permission to this ACL entry. Note: An entry can
 have multiple permissions.

 @param permission the permission to be associated with
 the principal in this entry.

 @return true if the permission was added, false if the
 permission was already part of this entry's permission set.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public boolean java.security.acl.AclEntry.removePermission(Permission permission)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Removes the specified permission from this ACL entry.

 @param permission the permission to be removed from this entry.

 @return true if the permission is removed, false if the
 permission was not part of this entry's permission set.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public boolean java.security.acl.AclEntry.checkPermission(Permission permission)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Checks if the specified permission is part of the
 permission set in this entry.

 @param permission the permission to be checked for.

 @return true if the permission is part of the
 permission set in this entry, false otherwise.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public java.util.Enumeration<java.security.acl.Permission> java.security.acl.AclEntry.permissions()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns an enumeration of the permissions in this ACL entry.

 @return an enumeration of the permissions in this ACL entry.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public java.lang.String java.security.acl.AclEntry.toString()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns a string representation of the contents of this ACL entry.

 @return a string representation of the contents.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public java.lang.Object java.security.acl.AclEntry.clone()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Clones this ACL entry.

 @return a clone of this ACL entry.
