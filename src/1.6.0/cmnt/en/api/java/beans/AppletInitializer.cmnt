 <p>
 This interface is designed to work in collusion with java.beans.Beans.instantiate.
 The interafce is intended to provide mechanism to allow the proper 
 initialization of JavaBeans that are also Applets, during their
 instantiation by java.beans.Beans.instantiate().

<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 <p>
 If passed to the appropriate variant of java.beans.Beans.instantiate
 this method will be called in order to associate the newly instantiated
 Applet (JavaBean) with its AppletContext, AppletStub, and Container.
 </p>
 <p>
 Conformant implementations shall:
 <ol>
 <li> Associate the newly instantiated Applet with the appropriate
 AppletContext.

 <li> Instantiate an AppletStub() and associate that AppletStub with
 the Applet via an invocation of setStub().

 <li> If BeanContext parameter is null, then it shall associate the
 Applet with its appropriate Container by adding that Applet to its
 Container via an invocation of add(). If the BeanContext parameter is
 non-null, then it is the responsibility of the BeanContext to associate
 the Applet with its Container during the subsequent invocation of its
 addChildren() method.
 </ol>
 </p>

 @param newAppletBean  The newly instantiated JavaBean
 @param bCtxt          The BeanContext intended for this Applet, or 
                       null.

public void java.beans.AppletInitializer.activate(Applet newApplet)

 <p>
 Activate, and/or mark Applet active. Implementors of this interface
 shall mark this Applet as active, and optionally invoke its start()
 method.

 @param newApplet  The newly instantiated JavaBean
