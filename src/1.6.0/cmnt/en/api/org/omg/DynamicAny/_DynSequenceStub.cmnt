public void org.omg.DynamicAny._DynSequenceStub.set_length(int len) throws org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAnyPackage.InvalidValue
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Sets the length of the sequence.
 Increasing the length of a sequence adds new elements at the tail without affecting the values
 of already existing elements. Newly added elements are default-initialized.
 Increasing the length of a sequence sets the current position to the first newly-added element
 if the previous current position was -1. Otherwise, if the previous current position was not -1,
 the current position is not affected.
 Decreasing the length of a sequence removes elements from the tail without affecting the value
 of those elements that remain. The new current position after decreasing the length of a sequence
 is determined as follows:
 <UL>
 <LI>If the length of the sequence is set to zero, the current position is set to -1.
 <LI>If the current position is -1 before decreasing the length, it remains at -1.
 <LI>If the current position indicates a valid element and that element is not removed when the length
     is decreased, the current position remains unaffected.
 <LI>If the current position indicates a valid element and that element is removed,
     the current position is set to -1.
 </UL>

 A DynAny object is created with a TypeCode value assigned to it.
 This TypeCode value determines the type of the value handled through the DynAny object.

public void org.omg.DynamicAny._DynSequenceStub.destroy()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Destroys a DynAny object.
 This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object.
 It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface
 or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy() to avoid resource leaks.
 Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects (for example, on objects returned by the
 current_component operation) does nothing.
 Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it.
 That is, references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid.
 Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST.
 It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny
 from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation
 before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained.

 such as DynStruct, creates the derived type but returns its reference as the DynAny base type.

 Sets the current position to index. The current position is indexed 0 to n-1, that is,

 a position that does not correspond to a component.
 Calling seek with a negative index is legal. It sets the current position to -1 to indicate
 no component and returns false. Passing a non-negative index value for a DynAny that does not

 <UL>
 <LI>For sequences, the operation returns the current number of elements.
 <LI>For structures, exceptions, and value types, the operation returns the number of members.
 <LI>For arrays, the operation returns the number of elements.
 <LI>For unions, the operation returns 2 if the discriminator indicates that a named member is active,
 otherwise, it returns 1.

public org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAny org.omg.DynamicAny._DynSequenceStub.current_component() throws org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAnyPackage.TypeMismatch
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns the DynAny for the component at the current position.
 It does not advance the current position, so repeated calls to current_component
 without an intervening call to rewind, next, or seek return the same component.
 The returned DynAny object reference can be used to get/set the value of the current component.
 If the current component represents a complex type, the returned reference can be narrowed
 based on the TypeCode to get the interface corresponding to the to the complex type.
 Calling current_component on a DynAny that cannot have components,
 such as a DynEnum or an empty exception, raises TypeMismatch.
 Calling current_component on a DynAny whose current position is -1 returns a nil reference.
 The iteration operations, together with current_component, can be used
 to dynamically compose an any value. After creating a dynamic any, such as a DynStruct,
 current_component and next can be used to initialize all the components of the value.
 Once the dynamic value is completely initialized, to_any creates the corresponding any value.

 @exception TypeMismatch If called on a DynAny that cannot have components,
 such as a DynEnum or an empty exception
