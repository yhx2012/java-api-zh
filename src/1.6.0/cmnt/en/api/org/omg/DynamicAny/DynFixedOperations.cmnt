<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public interface org.omg.DynamicAny.DynFixedOperations extends org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAnyOperations
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 DynFixed objects support the manipulation of IDL fixed values.
 Because IDL does not have a generic type that can represent fixed types with arbitrary
 number of digits and arbitrary scale, the operations use the IDL string type.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public java.lang.String org.omg.DynamicAny.DynFixedOperations.get_value()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns the value of a DynFixed.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public boolean org.omg.DynamicAny.DynFixedOperations.set_value(String val) throws org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAnyPackage.TypeMismatch, org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAnyPackage.InvalidValue
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Sets the value of the DynFixed.
 The val string must contain a fixed string constant in the same format as used for IDL fixed-point literals.
 However, the trailing d or D is optional. The return value is true if val can be represented as the DynFixed
 without loss of precision. If val has more fractional digits than can be represented in the DynFixed,
 fractional digits are truncated and the return value is false.

 @exception TypeMismatch If val does not contain a valid fixed-point literal or contains extraneous
            characters other than leading or trailing white space
 @exception InvalidValue If val contains a value whose scale exceeds that of the DynFixed
            or is not initialized
