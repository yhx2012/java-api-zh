<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 DynValue objects support the manipulation of IDL non-boxed value types.
 The DynValue interface can represent both null and non-null value types.
 For a DynValue representing a non-null value type, the DynValue's components comprise
 the public and private members of the value type, including those inherited from concrete base value types,
 in the order of definition. A DynValue representing a null value type has no components
 and a current position of -1.
 <P>Warning: Indiscriminantly changing the contents of private value type members can cause the value type
 implementation to break by violating internal constraints. Access to private members is provided to support
 such activities as ORB bridging and debugging and should not be used to arbitrarily violate
 the encapsulation of the value type.
