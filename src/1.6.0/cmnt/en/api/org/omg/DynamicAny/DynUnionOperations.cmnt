public interface org.omg.DynamicAny.DynUnionOperations extends org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAnyOperations
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 DynUnion objects support the manipulation of IDL unions.
 A union can have only two valid current positions:
 <UL>
 <LI>zero, which denotes the discriminator
 <LI>one, which denotes the active member
 </UL>
 The component_count value for a union depends on the current discriminator:
 it is 2 for a union whose discriminator indicates a named member, and 1 otherwise.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAny org.omg.DynamicAny.DynUnionOperations.get_discriminator()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns the current discriminator value.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void org.omg.DynamicAny.DynUnionOperations.set_discriminator(DynAny d) throws org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAnyPackage.TypeMismatch
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Sets the discriminator of the DynUnion to the specified value.
 Setting the discriminator to a value that is consistent with the currently active union member
 does not affect the currently active member. Setting the discriminator to a value that is inconsistent
 with the currently active member deactivates the member and activates the member that is consistent
 with the new discriminator value (if there is a member for that value) by initializing the member
 to its default value.
 Setting the discriminator of a union sets the current position to 0 if the discriminator value
 indicates a non-existent union member (has_no_active_member returns true in this case).
 Otherwise, if the discriminator value indicates a named union member, the current position is set to 1
 (has_no_active_member returns false and component_count returns 2 in this case).

 @exception TypeMismatch if the TypeCode of the parameter is not equivalent to the TypeCode
            of the union's discriminator

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void org.omg.DynamicAny.DynUnionOperations.set_to_default_member() throws org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAnyPackage.TypeMismatch
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Sets the discriminator to a value that is consistent with the value of the default case of a union.
 It sets the current position to zero and causes component_count to return 2.

 @exception TypeMismatch if the union does not have an explicit default case

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void org.omg.DynamicAny.DynUnionOperations.set_to_no_active_member() throws org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAnyPackage.TypeMismatch
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Sets the discriminator to a value that does not correspond to any of the unions case labels.
 It sets the current position to zero and causes component_count to return 1.

 @exception TypeMismatch if the union has an explicit default case or if it uses the entire range
            of discriminator values for explicit case labels

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public boolean org.omg.DynamicAny.DynUnionOperations.has_no_active_member()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns true if the union has no active member, that is, the unions value consists solely
 of its discriminator because the discriminator has a value that is not listed as an explicit case label.
 Calling this operation on a union that has a default case returns false.
 Calling this operation on a union that uses the entire range of discriminator values
 for explicit case labels returns false.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public org.omg.CORBA.TCKind org.omg.DynamicAny.DynUnionOperations.discriminator_kind()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns the TCKind value of the discriminators TypeCode.

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public org.omg.CORBA.TCKind org.omg.DynamicAny.DynUnionOperations.member_kind() throws org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAnyPackage.InvalidValue
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns the TCKind value of the currently active members TypeCode. 

 @exception InvalidValue if the union does not have a currently active member

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAny org.omg.DynamicAny.DynUnionOperations.member() throws org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAnyPackage.InvalidValue
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns the currently active member. Note that the returned reference remains valid only
 for as long as the currently active member does not change. Using the returned reference
 beyond the life time of the currently active member raises OBJECT_NOT_EXIST. 

 @exception InvalidValue if the union has no active member

<!-- END DATA -->
<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public java.lang.String org.omg.DynamicAny.DynUnionOperations.member_name() throws org.omg.DynamicAny.DynAnyPackage.InvalidValue
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns the name of the currently active member. If the unions TypeCode does not contain
 a member name for the currently active member, the operation returns an empty string.

 @exception InvalidValue if the union has no active member

<!-- END DATA -->
