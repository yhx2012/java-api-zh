<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Portable Interceptors Current (also known as <code>PICurrent</code>) 
 is merely a slot table, the slots of which are used by each service to 
 transfer their context data between their context and the request's or 
 reply's service context. Each service which wishes to use PICurrent 
 reserves a slot or slots at initialization time and uses those slots 
 during the processing of requests and replies.
 <p>
 Before an invocation is made, PICurrent is obtained via a call to 
 <code>ORB.resolve_initial_references( "PICurrent" )</code>. From within 
 the interception points, the data on PICurrent that has moved from the 
 thread scope to the request scope is available via the 
 <code>get_slot</code> operation on the <code>RequestInfo</code> object. 
 A PICurrent can still be obtained via 
 <code>resolve_initial_references</code>, but that is the Interceptor's 
 thread scope PICurrent.

public org.omg.CORBA.Any org.omg.PortableInterceptor.CurrentOperations.get_slot(int id) throws org.omg.PortableInterceptor.InvalidSlot
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Retrieves the slot data the application set in PICurrent via 
 <code>get_slot</code>.  The data is in the form of an Any. 
 <p>
 If the given slot has not been set, an Any containing a type code 
 with a <code>TCKind</code> value of <code>tk_null</code> and no value 
 is returned. 

 @param id The <code>SlotId</code> of the slot from which the data will 
     be returned. 
 @return The data, in the form of an Any, of the given slot identifier.
 @exception InvalidSlot thrown if get_slot is called on a slot that 
     has not been allocated. 
 @exception BAD_INV_ORDER thrown if <code>get_slot</code> is called 
     from within an ORB initializer

public void org.omg.PortableInterceptor.CurrentOperations.set_slot(int id, Any data) throws org.omg.PortableInterceptor.InvalidSlot
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Sets data in a slot. The data is in the form of an Any. If data 
 already exists in that slot, it is overridden. 

 @param id The <code>SlotId</code> of the slot to which the data will 
     be set. 
 @param data The data, in the form of an Any, which will be set 
     to the identified slot. 
 @exception InvalidSlot thrown if <code>set_slot</code> is called on 
     a slot that has not been allocated.
 @exception BAD_INV_ORDER thrown if <code>set_slot</code> is called 
     from within an ORB initializer.
