public interface org.omg.CORBA.portable.ValueFactory
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 The ValueFactory interface is the native mapping for the IDL 
 type CORBA::ValueFactory. The read_value() method is called by 
 the ORB runtime while in the process of unmarshaling a value type. 
 A user shall implement this method as part of implementing a type 
 specific value factory. In the implementation, the user shall call 
 is.read_value(java.io.Serializable) with a uninitialized valuetype 
 to use for unmarshaling. The value returned by the stream is 
 the same value passed in, with all the data unmarshaled.
 @see org.omg.CORBA_2_3.ORB
