public interface org.omg.CORBA.IRObjectOperations
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 This is the Operations interface for the mapping from <tt>IRObject</tt>.
 Several interfaces are used as base interfaces for objects in 
 the Interface Repository (IR). These base interfaces are not instantiable.
 A common set of operations is used to locate objects within the 
 Interface Repository. Some of these operations are defined in 
 the IRObject. All IR objects inherit from the IRObject interface, 
 which provides an operation for identifying the actual type of 
 the object. (The IDL base interface IRObject represents the most 
 generic interface from which all other Interface Repository interfaces 
 are derived, even the Repository itself.) All java implementations of 
 IR objects must implement the IRObjectOperations interface.

public org.omg.CORBA.DefinitionKind org.omg.CORBA.IRObjectOperations.def_kind()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Returns the <code>DefinitionKind</code> corresponding to this Interface Repository object.
 @return the <code>DefinitionKind</code> corresponding to this Interface Repository object.

<!-- BEGIN KEY -->
public void org.omg.CORBA.IRObjectOperations.destroy()
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Destroys this object. If the object is a Container,
 this method is applied to all its contents. If the object contains an IDLType
 attribute for an anonymous type, that IDLType is destroyed.
 If the object is currently contained in some other object, it is removed.
 If the method is invoked on a <code>Repository</code> or on a <code>PrimitiveDef</code>
 then the <code>BAD_INV_ORDER</code> exception is raised with minor value 2.
 An attempt to destroy an object that would leave the repository in an
 incoherent state causes <code>BAD_INV_ORDER</code> exception to be raised
 with the minor code 1.
 @exception BAD_INV_ORDER if this method is invoked on a repository or
            <code>PrimitiveDef</code>, or if an attempt to destroy an
            object would leave the repository in an incoherent state
