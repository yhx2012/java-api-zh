 It is often useful in the real world to be able to identify the 
 particular kind of ORB an object reference is coming from, to work 
 around problems with that particular ORB, or exploit shared 
 efficiencies. 
 <p>
 The <code>TAG_ORB_TYPE</code> component has an associated value of 
 type unsigned long (Java long), encoded as a CDR encapsulation, 
 designating an ORB type ID allocated by the OMG for the ORB type of the 
 originating ORB. Anyone may register any ORB types by submitting 
 a short (one-paragraph) description of the ORB type to the OMG, 
 and will receive a new ORB type ID in return. A list of ORB type 
 descriptions and values will be made available on the OMG web server. 
 <p>
 The <code>TAG_ORB_TYPE</code> component can appear at most once in 
 any IOR profile. For profiles supporting IIOP 1.1 or greater, it 
 is optionally present.
