<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 A servant manager supplies a POA with the ability 
 to activate objects on demand when the POA receives 
 a request targeted at an inactive object. A servant 
 manager is registered with a POA as a callback object, 
 to be invoked by the POA when necessary.
 ServantManagers can either be ServantActivators or
 ServantLocators. A ServantManager object must be 
 local to the process containing the POA objects 
 it is registered with.
