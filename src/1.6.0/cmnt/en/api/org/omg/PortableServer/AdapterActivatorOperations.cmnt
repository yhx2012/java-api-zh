<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 An adapter activator supplies a POA with the ability 
 to create child POAs on demand, as a side-effect of 
 receiving a request that names the child POA 
 (or one of its children), or when find_POA is called 
 with an activate parameter value of TRUE.

public boolean org.omg.PortableServer.AdapterActivatorOperations.unknown_adapter(POA parent, String name)
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 This operation is invoked when the ORB receives 
 a request for an object reference that identifies 
 a target POA that does not exist. The ORB invokes 
 this operation once for each POA that must be 
 created in order for the target POA to exist.
 @param parent indicates the parent POA for the POA
               that needs to be created.
 @param name identifies the name of the POA relative to
             the parent.
 @return returns TRUE if the POA was created or FALSE
         otherwise.
