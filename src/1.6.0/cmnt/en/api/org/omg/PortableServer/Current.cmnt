<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 The PortableServer::Current interface, derived from 
 CORBA::Current, provides method implementations with 
 access to the identity of the object on which the 
 method was invoked. The Current interface is provided 
 to support servants that implement multiple objects, 
 but can be used within the context of POA-dispatched 
 method invocations on any servant. To provide location 
 transparency, ORBs are required to support use of 
 Current in the context of both locally and remotely 
 invoked operations. An instance of Current can be 
 obtained by the application by issuing the 
 CORBA::ORB::resolve_initial_references("POACurrent") 
 operation. Thereafter, it can be used within the 
 context of a method dispatched by the POA to obtain 
 the POA and ObjectId that identify the object on 
 which that operation was invoked.
