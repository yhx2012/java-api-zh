<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 When the POA has the NON_RETAIN policy it uses servant 
 managers that are ServantLocators. Because the POA 
 knows that the servant returned by this servant 
 manager will be used only for a single request, 
 it can supply extra information to the servant 
 manager's operations and the servant manager's pair 
 of operations may be able to cooperate to do 
 something different than a ServantActivator. 
 When the POA uses the ServantLocator interface, 
 immediately after performing the operation invocation 
 on the servant returned by preinvoke, the POA will 
 invoke postinvoke on the servant manager, passing the 
 ObjectId value and the Servant value as parameters 
 (among others). This feature may be used to force 
 every request for objects associated with a POA to 
 be mediated by the servant manager.
