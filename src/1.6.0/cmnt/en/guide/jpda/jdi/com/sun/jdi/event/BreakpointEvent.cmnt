 Notification of a breakpoint in the target VM. 
 The breakpoint event 
 is generated before the code at its location is executed. 
 When a location
 is reached which satisfies a currently enabled 
 {@link com.sun.jdi.request.BreakpointRequest breakpoint request}, 
 an {@link EventSet event set}
 containing an instance of this class will be added
 to the VM's event queue.
