public interface com.sun.jdi.event.MethodExitEvent extends com.sun.jdi.event.LocatableEvent
<!-- END KEY -->
<!-- BEGIN DATA -->
 Notification of a method return in the target VM. This event
 is generated after all code in the method has executed, but the 
 location of this event is the last executed location in the method. 
 Method exit events are generated for both native and non-native 
 methods. Method exit events are not generated if the method terminates
 with a thrown exception.
